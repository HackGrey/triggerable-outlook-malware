# triggerable-outlook-malware
During my training with eLearsecurity at the Advanced level, there was a session video corse (**<ins>not a lab</ins>**) talking about how to developpe a triggerable outlook malware. 
So i decided to **create a very detailed tutorial (PDF format) about how we can make it**.
Have a good reading and feel free to drop your comments
